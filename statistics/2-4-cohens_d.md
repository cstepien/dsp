[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

```python
from __future__ import print_function, division
import numpy as np
import nsfg
import first


def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()
    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)
    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / np.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d


preg = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]
firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
others = live[live.birthord != 1]

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
```

Cohen's D for weight of first born babies vs. other babies (-0.089) is larger than that of pregnancy length for first babies vs. other babies (0.029).
